    "**Original Hypothesis:**<br>\n",
    "Twitter sentiment data is a useful tool for predicting polling averages in the 2020 presidential election.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract:**<br>\n",
    "Twitter is a social media network where individuals/organizations write posts to their followers. Each \"Tweet\" can contain up to 280 characters, and can include links, photos, and video. While Twitter is not the most popular social media platform, it has carved out a niche for itself as being an important space for political discussion and news coverage. This perception has been fueled by the many political movements which have been organized through Twitter such as Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. As a result, one could argue that Twitter could be used as a powerful predictive tool for political sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test Twitter's political predictive power, I created sentiment indexes for the 2020 presidential candidates using the VADER Sentiment Analysis method; these indexes were compared with the 2020 presidential polling data compiled by Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight. The data from the period from September 1st to November 3rd indicated that there was a positive correlation between Donald Trump's polling average and the two sentiment indexes. Joe Biden's polling average did not appear to have any correlation with the sentiment indexes. Since both the Twitter and polling data have dates associated with them, it is possible to use time-series analysis techniques to study the relationships between them. Granger-causality analyses of the data demonstrated that the reverse of the hypothesis was  true, in that the changes in the Twitter sentiment indexes were actually being caused by changes in the polls. \n",

    "2020 was one of the most tumultuous years in American history. The Covid-19 pandemic completely disrupted the lives of the American people, forcing them to hunker down in their own homes for several months. The Covid restrictions put forward by the government helped to reduce the spread of the pandemic, however, there were massive economic and social repercussions as a result of the lockdowns. With people in their homes unable to go to work, unemployment skyrocketed and the economy experienced a severe recession. \n",
